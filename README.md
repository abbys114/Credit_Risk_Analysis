# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create models with the data to predict credit risk. We then assessed the models and made a recomendation if they are accurate enough to use.

## Results: 
-Naive Random Oversampling
  -Recall Score: 0.68
  -Accuracy Score: 0.64
  -Precision Score: 0.99
  -Precision score is high, and recall and accuracy scores are moderate
-SMOTE Oversampling
  -Recall Score: 0.66
  -Accuracy Score: 0.64
  -Precision Score: 0.99
  --Precision score is high, and recall and accuracy scores are moderate
-Undersampling
  -Recall Score: 0.45
  -Accuracy Score: 0.52
  -Precision Score: 0.99
  -Precision score is high, recall score is low, and accuracy score is moderate
-Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
  -Recall Score: 0.57
  -Accuracy Score: 0.62
  -Precision Score: 0.99 
  -Precision score is high, and recall and accuracy scores are moderate
-Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  -Recall Score: 0.87
  -Accuracy Score: 
  -Precision Score: 0.99 
  -Precision and recall score is high 
-Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
  -Recall Score: 0.94
  -Accuracy Score: 0.93
  -Precision Score: 0.99 
  - Precision, recall, and accuracy scores are high

## Summary: 
The results of the machine learning models vary in precision, recall and accuracy scores.  Based on the models we ran, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model is the most accurate at predicting credit risk based on precision, recall and accuracy scores.
